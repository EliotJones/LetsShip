# Let's Ship - PriceFalcon #

The aim of this repository is to share the experience of developing and shipping a working .NET 5 application including deployments, dev-ops, migrations, etc.

This will be a learning experience for me and hopefully the write up will help people get up to speed with .NET 5 if they've never used it before, including deploying to Linux machines.
