> From `dotnet new` to production in as little time and money as possible.

Some things are very difficult and some things are very easy.

One easy thing is coming up with ideas for new projects. One difficult thing is actually seeing a project through to completion. Another easy thing is feeling like crap because you have a pile of half-started projects. (another very difficult thing is coming up with commercially viable ideas)

To that end I wanted to take a lousy idea and see it through to an MVP in the least possible time, and because I'm cheap, the least possible money. I also wanted to share that process because I believe .NET is hugely neglected when it comes to building out MVPs; and the more interesting projects are built in .NET the more interesting .NET jobs there are. As someone once said "be the change you want to see in the world".

This post is part 1 in a 4 part series, the other 3 parts are:

- Architecture and design
- Docker and GitHub actions
- Deploying with k3s

A note on using .NET for this, like I said above I am all-in on .NET. A framework with brilliant developer experience, a good pace of innovation in language design and fully cross-platform.

But the best language/framework to build an MVP in is the one you already know. If you're on the fence about what to use to build your MVP just choose what you know. Yes the cool kids will sneer at you, but the hard problems in any project are the squishy ones, getting people to use/pay for your product. Technical problems are easy by comparison.

Most of the internet probably still runs on PHP and given Netflix hard-crashes 3 times every time I try to watch something on it, but I still use it, we vastly over-estimate the importance of technical choices.

## Introduction

In order for this to be a useful experience for others I wanted to build something relatively non-trivial, i.e. not just another todo app or blog platform.

We'll be building a website that allows the end user to submit a product listing from another site and automatically monitor that product for price changes. There are probably loads of services that do a similar thing better, however this isn't an attempt to build something commercially viable.

[PriceFalcon](https://pricefalcon.me)

I'm not going to go in-depth on the actual coding part since that would be a blog series on its own. In part 2 I'll talk briefly about some of the architectural choices and overall design. The finished code is available for reference [on GitHub](https://github.com/EliotJones/LetsShip).

(a note on licensing, I've added a licence into the subfolders where the code is open source. I haven't open sourced the entire thing because I don't want people just copying and deploying it themselves, but feel free to poke around and take ideas from it)

## Create the project

In order to build a .NET project we'll first need .NET installed. You can install the SDK for Windows, Linux and macOS from [the Microsoft website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). You want to grab the .NET 5.0 SDK.

To find out what version of .NET you are running open a command line and type:

```
dotnet --version
```

If you get:

```
'dotnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Then you haven't installed it yet or it's not on your path. Google around for troubleshooting installs on your specific OS. My `dotnet version` is `5.0.102`.

To start off we'll be using the `dotnet` CLI to familiarise ourselves with .NET in an OS independent way. For the actual development we'll probably want to use a full IDE such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)/[Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) on non-Windows systems.

To see what templates are available you can type:

```
dotnet new
```

Which has a lot of output like this:

```

There are a lot of different options for building a web app in .NET. I first learned MVC back in 2013 and it's still a viable way to build sites so I'll be sticking with what I know. To get more information about options for a specific template we can run:

```
dotnet new mvc --help
```

The options that are relevant for us are the project name (`-n`) and output location (`-o`). I don't want authentication yet for this project. Inside the `src` folder of my project directory I ran:

```
dotnet new mvc -n PriceFalcon.Web -o PriceFalcon.Web
```

Which will create a new MVC app called PriceFalcon.Web in the PriceFalcon.Web folder.

We're going to have a few more projects though so we need a Solution (`.sln`) file which is used to group projects and provide a way to build that group. We can create one of these from the command line too. Inside the `src` folder:

```
dotnet new sln -n PriceFalcon
```

This creates an empty Solution. It isn't linked to the web project we just created yet. For the next steps I'll be using Visual Studio 2019 to work with multiple projects since no-one remembers syntax for `.sln` files.

[The code at this stage](https://github.com/EliotJones/LetsShip/tree/8603aaec076bde75c5885aedaaa18153c4aa3e22). Note that I also added a `.gitignore` file in the project root since there are a bunch of files that we don't want included in the repository.

## Link the solution to the project

Inside Visual Studio you can right click the Solution node and select `Add > Existing Project...` to link the web project `.csproj` file to the solution. Once that's done if you hit `Ctrl + Shift + B` it should restore packages and build successfully.

I think the process is very similar in Rider.

## Data for developers

We'll want a database for our website.

Sidebar rant: I think life would generally be far simpler if developers were much more respectful to their databases and treated them as the most important component of their entire codebase. Once data gets screwed it is very hard to un-screw. And the source of much of that screwedness is usually application code. Every developer is a clown. We all make mistakes and trying to do the job of an RDBMS in your application code is asking for trouble. None of us are exempt from stupid mistakes and by utilising a database with a well thought out schema we reduce the blast-radius of our clownery. Using a SQL database properly, or even passably, with constraints and a sensible schema is perhaps the number one thing every developer should learn. You're almost never a special enough snowflake to need to go schemaless, in my humble opinion.

There are lots of good options (and some not so good options) to choose from for a database, we'll be using PostgreSQL since it's free and well known but you could use MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL, etc. PostgreSQL has support for the JSONB column type so if needed you can have islands of schemaless data in your database while keeping most of the data well controlled.

I once installed PostgreSQL on this laptop, or it was the laptop before this that broke, or the one before that that is now travelling Europe in a van somewhere. Developer machines are temporary, they get lost, fall down, break, etc. You don't want environment set-up for developers on your codebase (including yourself) to be something that takes more than a few tens of minutes. For that reason it makes sense to use Docker (or other container software) containers to run your database for development. You'll always have the same version as any other development environment and you can cause a catastrophe on your database without affecting others.

I'll also be using Docker to build containers for deploying the application in part 3 and 4 so [install it now](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

I created a `db` directory to store all local database related stuff. Inside `db` I created the `data` and `init` directories. Inside `init` we'll store the script run by the docker container when it first launches to create and configure the database. I created the file `init.sql` with the following content:

```
create user devwrite with encrypted password 'xE:UZj4buVy2&&3n';
grant all privileges on database pricefalcon to devwrite;
```

This creates the user `devwrite` with the password `xE:UZj4buVy2&&3n` and full control of the database `pricefalcon`.

(we'd probably want a less open permissions model for our database in future, for now we're just trying to ship something)

Inside the `db` folder we create a `docker-compose.yml` file. This defines the container to run with some related information such as environment variables. The contents of this file are:

```
version: "3.8"

services:
  postgresdb:
    container_name: pg_container
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root
      POSTGRES_DB: pricefalcon
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

volumes:
  data:
  init:
```

Version is the version of the file format, nothing related to the container. We also specify the root username and password `root`/`root` and the default database `pricefalcon` to be created.

The database listens on the container port `5432` and we map that to port `5432` of our local machine. We set the container to restart automatically, for example when we reboot our laptop using `restart: always`. And we mount the `data` and `init` folders. Data will be where the container stores the database files so that it is persistent between restarts and `init` is where we defined the script to create our database.

(though I said earlier that by using Docker we'll always get the same database version I didn't specify an image tag in this compose file to control the version, however you can easily specify an exact version. [Read more about configuring Docker and postgres](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/creating-and-filling-a-postgres-db-with-docker-compose-e1607f6f882f))

We can now run docker compose from a command line to start the container:

```
docker-compose up
```

The output should indicate that the container has been created and started:

```

```

At this point you can close the command line from the red 'x' (don't use `ctrl + c` since that terminates the container) and the container will continue running in the background, even across restarts. There is an option (`-d`) to run `docker-compose up` without attaching to the container but it doesn't really matter here.

(note: It appears docker might cache the postgres details if you've previously run postgres in a container, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/56682187 if you have trouble.)

(additional note, YAML is a horrid config format and is whitespace sensitive, if you're getting errors check the indentation)

It's also useful to have a script to completely rebuild the database if you mess up, I create a `force-restart.bat` file in the `db` directory:

```
docker-compose down
rmdir /S /Q .\data
mkdir data
docker-compose up
```

This deletes all existing data and rebuilds the container (on Windows).

Finally for a GUI tool to interact with the database I recommend [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/). It's free and handles most database types well enough so you don't need a separate GUI tool for each DB.

We can connect to our newly created database with the username and password `root`/`root` and database name `pricefalcon`:

![Connection](https://github.com/EliotJones/LetsShip/blob/main/docs/images/img004.png?type=raw)

[The code so far](https://github.com/EliotJones/LetsShip/tree/357c15b377696a8f1798fd26e4244eb4074fdc0d), note that I added `db/data/` to the `.gitignore` file so that the temporary database files aren't included in the repository.

In the next post we'll talk about the high-level architecture and in more detail about parts of the code of interest. And no doubt some more sidebar rants.
