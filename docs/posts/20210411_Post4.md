# Lets Ship: Kubernetes and production

This is the 4th post in the Lets Ship series. Post 1 covered the introduction and setting up a very simple project structure. Post 2 covered the high level design and architecture. Post 3 covered creating Docker containers for the application and publishing them to GitHub Container Registry. In this final post we'll cover provisioning a server and deploying the Docker containers to production.

## Get a server

Docker enables to ship our containerised application on any cloud provider. For example [Linode](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) has a managed service for shipping containers with Kubernetes. Alternatively AWS, GCP and Azure each have different ways of shipping and managing containerized applications.

For this tutorial I'll be using a server (VPS) from [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). This probably works out slightly more expensive than a cloud native offering for a small, low traffic, application like this. However I detest AWS and wanted experience setting up Kubernetes from as low a level as possible. Ultimately the cloud providers are probably a better option when creating a Kubernetes cluster since the set-up with a single VPS (single node cluster) introduces a single point of failure whereas the cloud providers can manage most of the complexity and resilience for you.
