# Lets Ship: Docker and GitHub actions

This is the 3rd post in the Lets Ship series. Post 1 covered the introduction and setting up a very simple project structure. Post 2 covered the high level design and architecture. In this post we'll cover containerising our application and building using GitHub actions.

## Docker for deployment

By packaging our application into a Docker container we can ensure the build artifact has all necessary dependencies, system libraries and services necessary to run in production. We uncouple our application from a specific server and produce a reproducible packaged application that can run on any container-enabled service or server.

With .NET Core (now .NET 5) containerization of .NET apps has become extremely easy. Microsoft provide [a set of base images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) for .NET apps that provide a working .NET environment out-of-the-box.

For our finished application we need a container for our MVC web application and one for our Selenium crawler application. We'll start with the web application.

We use Dockerfiles to specify how to build our container image. Each command in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the resulting image. Layers build on top of each other to produce the final image. For example you might have the following layers:

- Use Ubuntu 20.04
- Install Python
- Create a directory
- etc...

There's a [good tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/dotnetcore/) on creating Dockerfiles for .NET applications. Our resulting Dockerfile is quite similar, we'll go through it step by step:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-alpine3.13 as build
LABEL stage=builder

WORKDIR /build

COPY src .

# dotnet restore is a hefty boi, if it is run separately it can be cached.
# linux-musl-x64 is for lightweight containers like alpine linux.
RUN dotnet restore -v n -r linux-musl-x64 PriceFalcon.Web/PriceFalcon.Web.csproj

# Run the publish targeting the same runtime but with no restore.
RUN dotnet publish -v n --no-restore -c Release -r linux-musl-x64 -o web PriceFalcon.Web/PriceFalcon.Web.csproj

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:5.0.4-alpine3.13 as run

# Create a user called "app" who has ownership of the "app" directory.
RUN adduser --disabled-password --home /app --gecos '' app && chown -R app /app

USER app

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /build/web .

ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:6110 \
    SiteUrl=http://localhost:6110

EXPOSE 6110

ENTRYPOINT [ "./PriceFalcon.Web" ]
```

Firstly we define a base image to start building from. We use the predefined Microsoft provided image:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-alpine3.13 as build
```

This tells Docker we're using an Alpine Linux 3.13 image with the .NET 5.0 SDK installed on it.

The .NET SDK includes the build tools necessary to build and publish our application, e.g. `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish`.

Alpine Linux is a lightweight operating system built on the Linux kernel. By using Alpine Linux we can reduce the size of the resulting image.

Reducing image size is important where we're charged for inbound/outbound traffic since transferring large Dockerfiles could quickly increase our bill. Many private Docker registries such as Azure and AWS will charge for traffic to/from the registry so it's cost effective to make the resulting image as small as possible.

The important bit here is the `as build` at the end of the line. We're using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) here. This allows us to split the build of our container into separate stages, each one using a different base image. In this case we're splitting the build of the application from the final image used to run it.

Splitting build from run makes sense because the .NET SDK includes many tools we don't actually need to run the application. By leaving the build tools in the first of the 2 stages we don't need to ship the full SDK in the final image, again reducing image size. Note that `as build` is arbitrary naming, the stage name can be anything you desire, e.g. `as penguin`.

Next up we define a directory/folder inside our `build` stage image to store the raw (not compiled) source-code in:

```
WORKDIR /build
```

This tells Docker the next commands will run inside a folder called `build`, again the naming is arbitrary here and unrelated to the name of the stage.

Next up we copy the raw source code from our repository on the host system (either our computer or the GitHub actions runner machine) into our current location `.` inside the Docker container. Remember we just set our current location (`.`) to the folder called `build`:

```
COPY src .
```

This copies all files and folders from the `src` folder of our repository into the current working directory (`build`) inside our Docker container.

(note that there are 2 ways to get files and folders from outside the Docker image into it, `COPY` and `ADD`. [This question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24958140/what-is-the-difference-between-the-copy-and-add-commands-in-a-dockerfile) goes into some more details).

So now we have our source code inside our Docker container and the .NET 5 SDK included from the base image. The next step is to build and publish the code:

```
RUN dotnet restore -v n -r linux-musl-x64 PriceFalcon.Web/PriceFalcon.Web.csproj
```

A useful optimization that Docker provides is that it will cache layers when building a Dockerfile. This means that if the layer is unchanged it will use the existing layer when re-building, making the build quicker. For this reason it is useful to split the `restore` and `publish` steps of the build using `dotnet`.

Here we run `dotnet restore` inside the `build` folder. Since we copied from `src` to `build` in the earlier step the contents of the `build` folder are identical to the `src` folder of our repository, therefore the specified path to restore `PriceFalcon.Web/PriceFalcon.Web.csproj` is relative to the `src` folder.

The `-v n` flag sets verbosity of the logging to `normal` rather than the default `quiet`. I added this because my laptop seemed to have a problem where `dotnet restore` inside a Dockerfile build would hang forever until the build was cancelled and the Docker service was restarted so the logging could help me see if the restore was still running or broken.

The important part here is the `-r linux-musl-x64` flag. This tells `dotnet restore` to restore for the runtime (`-r`) `linux-musl-x64`. This targets Linux distributions that use the `musl` version of `libc`, this includes Alpine Linux, the base image we are using. Read more about runtime identifiers [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

After restore has completed we need to publish the application. We're publishing a self-contained application (including the version of .NET it needs to run) so that our runtime container can be as small as possible:

```
RUN dotnet publish -v n --no-restore -c Release -r linux-musl-x64 -o web PriceFalcon.Web/PriceFalcon.Web.csproj
```

Again we define the normal verbosity (`-v n`), since this step also seemed to crash occassionally, as well as the Alpine Linux specific runtime `-r linux-musl-x64`. We also specify `--no-restore` so that `dotnet` doesn't duplicate the restore we just ran. In addition we specify the published build should use the `Release` configuration, rather than `Debug` (`-c Release`). Finally we specify the output folder relative to our current directory (`build`), I chose to call the folder `web` and specified this using `-o web`. This means the published application code will be in the `build/web` folder on the build image.

We now have our published application and the work for the build stage of our multi-stage build is complete.

Next up we define the runtime environment for our image:

```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:5.0.4-alpine3.13 as run
```

Again we're using Alpine Linux 3.13 from the official Microsoft base images but we're using the `runtime-deps` image. The runtime dependencies image has the following description:

> This image contains the native dependencies needed by .NET. It does not include .NET. It is for self-contained applications.

This includes things like various C libraries needed to run .NET applications on the specific Linux distribution but not .NET itself which we packaged with the application during our publish step by specifying the runtime identifier (`-r linux-musl-x64`).

We give this stage the alias `run` using `as run` for our multi-stage build.

Because it's [a bad idea](https://americanexpress.io/do-not-run-dockerized-applications-as-root/) to run things as the default Linux user `root` we create a new user called `app` with the home directory called `app` to run our web application as:

```
RUN adduser --disabled-password --home /app --gecos '' app && chown -R app /app
```

We also give ownership of the `app` folder to our `app` user using the change owner command: `chown -R app /app`.

Next we switch the following commands to run as our newly created user and set the working directory to their home directory `/app`:

```
USER app

WORKDIR /app
```

Then we copy the published artifacts from our previous build stage into the current app folder:

```
COPY --from=build /build/web .
```

The `--from` parameter specifies that we're copying from the `/build/web` folder of a build stage called `build` rather than from the host machine, into the current folder `.` of our image.

Next we define a couple of environment variables. 1 is used by ASP.NET to select the port to listen on for HTTP traffic. The other is defined in my code as the URL for the site when sending emails:

```
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:6110 \
    SiteUrl=http://localhost:6110

EXPOSE 6110
```

The `EXPOSE` tells Docker to expose port `6110` of the container, this is the same port we told ASP.NET to listen on using `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:6110`.

Finally we're ready to run the application, we define the entrypoint which is the "thing that Docker will run when the image is started". Because we published a self-contained app this is the `PriceFalcon.Web` file produced for the Linux build:

```
ENTRYPOINT [ "./PriceFalcon.Web" ]
```

Now when we run this image it will start the web application listening on port 6110 of the container.
